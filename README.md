# Graph Machine for Paper Classification in Citation Network

This tutorial is aimed to show how you can use modern graph machine learning techniques to solve real-world problems. 
Graph ML extends traditional ML approaches by accounting for the relationships and structures inherent in graph data, where entities are nodes and relationships are edges.
Graphs are everywhere: from social networks like Facebook to biological networks where nodes represent proteins and edges represent interactions.
The purpose of a graph is to present data that are too numerous or complicated to be described adequately in the text and in less space.

### Note
Use GCN for simplicity and efficiency on balanced or small datasets and GAT or SSP for noisy or complex graphs requiring selective focus or scalability.
